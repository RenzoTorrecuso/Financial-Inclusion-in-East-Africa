Dear visitor,

Thank you for passing by.

What does this project search?

First I search to extract valuable information from the dataset with EDA. Second, I suggest the best performing predictive model to identify bank account holders.

What is the value of this Product?

The value of this product is that it offers high accuracy and precision in predicting if potential business clients have a bank account in East Africa. I also identify the most valuable type of input informations to feed this model.



Please refer to the notebook Financial_Inclusion_East_Africa.ipynb .

There you will find everything you need: A summary of all steps, the code, plots, and inside and outside all cells comments where I explain the evolution of the project, step by step. 

Please feel free to send any comments/suggestions/corrections.

Again, thank you for your precious time and interest.

All best wishes.

Renzo
