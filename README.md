Dear visitor,

Thank you for passing by.

Please refer to the notebook Financial_Inclusion_East_Africa.ipynb .

There you will find everything you need: A summary of all steps, the code, plots, and inside and outside all cells comments where I explain the evolution of the project, step by step. 

Please feel free to send any comments/suggestions/corrections.

Again, thank you for your precious time and interest.

All best wishes.

Renzo
